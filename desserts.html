            <h3>Directions</h3>
        <p>
            Dough: Cut the butter and shortening into ¼” cubes and chill.  Combine the ice water and lemon juice and keep cold.  In a mixer combine the first three ingredients.  Add all of the butter and shortening and mix on medium speed until the dough is crumbly and the butter is the size of small pebbles.  Add the ice water mixture and mix just until the dough comes together.  Flatten the dough into ½” disk and chill for 30 minutes.  Roll the dough out to 1/8” thickness and press it into a pie pan.  Again chill the dough for 30 minutes while the oven preheats to 350 degrees.  Line the crust with parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans and bake for 20-25 minutes.  You want the crust to be partially baked, with no color but no longer doughy.  Remove from the oven.  Allow to cool.  Remove the pie weights and parchment. After below filling is completed, fill the shell and finish baking per instructions below.
Almond Filling: With a stand mixer and a paddle attachment on medium speed, paddle the butter and sugar for several minutes until light and fluffy.  Add the eggs one at a time, paddling for a minute between each addition.  Add the vanilla extract with the last egg.
In a separate bowl combine the spices, salt, almonds, orange zest and pancake mix. Add the dry ingredients into the butter/egg mixture and mix until just combined.  Spread the jam into the bottom of the tart shell and spoon the almond mixture on top.  Bake in a 350 degree oven for 30 minutes or until golden brown and a knife inserted into the center comes out clean.
Cranberry Compote:  Combine all of the compote ingredients above and cook in a sauce pan over medium heat for 20-30 minutes until the cranberries are soft but still hold their shape.  Chill.  Remove the ginger and orange slices before spooning on top of tart and serving.
